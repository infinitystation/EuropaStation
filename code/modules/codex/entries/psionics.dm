	lore_text = "<b>Psionics</b> is the catch-all common name for a very broad category of often inexplicable \
	effects resulting from the minds of sentient creatures infected by the Sagittarius Signal, a transmission \
	of alien origin that induces madness, deformity and psionic operancy in those it infects. Although understanding \
	of these effects is limited, and in many cases simply trying to understand the mechanisms of psi is enough to \
	trigger the infection, a tentative body of knowledge has been collected, predominantly in the vaults of Neptune \
	and in the far Oort Cloud.<br><br> \
	The general consensus holds that psi abuses the manner in which some esoteric forms of computation cause ripples \
	in neighboring continua in order to manipulate our own continuum by proxy. This has led to the development of \
	psi-enhancing computerized devices such as psi-amps and a series of astonishingly illegal cerebroenergetic \
	enhancers that can turn a moderate to advanced operant psychokinetic into the human equivalent of a laser cannon."

	mechanics_text = "Psi-operancy is a complex topic. If you are (un)lucky enough to manifest psionic powers, \
	either from Aspects in character generation, Signal exposure during a round, or rolling the paramount \
	antagonist role, you will get a small brain HUD element on the bottom right. Clicking this element will \
	suppress/release your psi-power, and shift-left-clicking it to examine it will give you a breakdown of \
	your available powers, your ranks, and how to evoke each effect."

	increase the effective level of psi-powers to an otherwise almost unreachable height."
